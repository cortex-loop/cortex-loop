# CORTEX Status

Surface: product

_Generated from `internal/truth/cortex_status.json`. Edit the registry, then run `python3 internal/truth/generate_status.py`._

## Resting State

- Branch: `main`
- Rule: Clean synced main is the only resting state; the richer Cortex executive remains the product goal, and archive or lab surfaces do not define live product truth.

## Bootstrap

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/CORTEX_STATUS.md`
- `git branch --show-current`
- `git status --short --untracked-files=all`

## Goal

**Rich Executive For AI**

Cortex should be a richer multi-host executive layer for AI work: lifecycle-first, verification-aware, continuity-preserving, and capable of bounded correction without collapsing into host-specific hacks.

Not product:
- `diagnostics`
- `train loops`
- `graders`
- `workflow ledgers`
- `governance records`

## Identity And Research Stance

Cortex is the installable executive layer that wraps a model or host surface and adds executive function to the underlying brain without redefining the brain itself as the product.

Research stance:
- Steal executive skills from systems that already work, especially human executive function, then translate them into small lawful operators, state, gates, and proof surfaces.
- Use first-principles reasoning and live evidence together: start from packet law, then challenge or revise that law explicitly when repeated runtime evidence disproves it.
- Prefer brilliant concrete code when it cleanly realizes the intended executive skill; do not preserve a worse abstraction just because it matched an earlier local framing.

Answering stance:
- When describing Cortex, lead with shipping truth, conformance truth, the current train, and the active quality/risk focus. Surface the executive-completion denominator only on explicit denominator or progress-accounting questions.
- Always distinguish Cortex truth, shipping truth, conformance truth, and the current train.

## Live Product Truth

- Shipping default: `openai:operator_cli`
- Conformance truth: `openai=conformant`, `claude=conformant`, `gemini=conformant`, `reference=conformant`
- Accepted conformance next decision: `promote`

## Current Focus

- Current tracked train: `bounded-live-support-memory-reentry`
- Active quality/risk focus: The bounded AUX shadow surface still earns `full_cross_host`, durable support-memory distillation remains explicit and removable, posture-sensitive online control is now S-tier closed on the live runtime path, and anti-thrash is landed as an exact-family unchanged-condition repetition tax with posture/host-friction/evidence/probe reopen so repeated low-yield loops can be priced without suppressing stronger verification or novelty. Shipping and conformance still keep `Q_mem = 0`, route blockedness remains non-sovereign, raw SQLite episodes remain support-side only, and the next highest-leverage gap is bounded live support-memory re-entry through explicit distilled priors only.
- Next product train after the current focus: `bounded-live-support-memory-reentry`

## Bio-To-Code Matrix

| Executive Skill | What We Are Stealing | Status | Weight | Code Homes | Proof Surfaces | Next Move |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Truth-preserving commitments and bounded certification | Truth maintenance and reality binding | `landed` | `12` | `cortex/core`, `cortex/drivers` | `tests/product`, `tests/conformance` | Keep this foundation stable while richer executive control builds on top. |
| Bounded correction and verified-work preservation | Error repair without losing the main task thread | `landed` | `15` | `cortex/runtime`, `cortex/sre`, `cortex/hosts/openai` | `tests/product` | Keep preservation-state repair stable while support-side experiments stay removable and off the shipping critical path. |
| Uncertainty handling and brake | Hesitation and uncertainty-aware inhibition | `landed` | `13` | `cortex/sre` | `tests/product`, `tests/experimental` | Keep reference-derived brake and uncertainty control stable while AUX remains advisory and runtime-off-by-default. |
| Branch continuity, suspend/resume, and truthful closure | Working memory across interruptions plus truthful closure | `landed` | `15` | `cortex/sre`, `cortex/hosts/openai` | `tests/product`, `tests/conformance` | Keep suspend/resume and truthful closure stable now that host-local branch continuity is repaired across Claude, Gemini, and reference; branch-local continuity may reopen only from branch-linked cues, and any future support memory must remain explicit, optional, and non-binding. |
| Intervention pricing versus neutrality | Deciding when to intervene, stay neutral, or stop | `landed` | `10` | `cortex/sre`, `cortex/aux` | `tests/product`, `tests/experimental` | Hold calibrated intervention pricing stable now that posture-sensitive online control is S-tier closed and anti-thrash is landed on the live runtime path: posture truth is single-owned, the 6-axis route geometry stays bounded, `visible_burden_sensitivity` is surfaced as a separate utility scalar, unchanged-condition repetition is taxed only at the exact-family level with bounded reopen, and any later live memory re-entry must remain explicit, bounded, and separately earned. |
| Blocker surfacing and goal-debt management | Noticing unresolved blockers and unfinished intentions | `landed` | `10` | `cortex/sre`, `cortex/hosts/openai`, `cortex/hosts/claude`, `cortex/hosts/gemini`, `cortex/hosts/reference` | `tests/product`, `tests/conformance` | Keep typed goal-debt and closure-pressure state stable across hosts while support-side augmentation remains explicit and non-sovereign. |
| Multi-host executive continuity | One executive across different brains and contexts | `landed` | `15` | `cortex/hosts/openai`, `cortex/hosts/claude`, `cortex/hosts/gemini`, `cortex/hosts/reference` | `tests/product`, `tests/conformance` | Hold one Cortex law across OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and reference without flattening host-native realization. |
| Offline consolidation and support geometry | Sleep-like consolidation and support systems | `landed` | `10` | `cortex/aux` | `tests/experimental`, `tests/archive`, `tests/conformance` | Keep durable support-memory distillation explicit, removable, and non-sovereign now that the bounded AUX shadow surface earns `full_cross_host`; raw SQLite episodes stay support-side only, episode windows stay absolute-time correct, and positive priors must require repeated matched support rather than a generic second episode. |

## Math To Code Rules

- Every load-bearing executive skill must land as explicit law, typed code, and at least one proof surface.
- Every packet-level mathematical object should map to exactly one typed code object or operator family with one owning module.
- Every typed load-bearing code object should have one clear home and one explicit test or proof surface.
- Forbidden leaks across Core, SRE, AUX, host wiring, and lab proof surfaces must be explicit.
- Law revision rule: The current math is binding landing law until live evidence disproves or narrows it. When that happens, revise the law explicitly and update the code and proof surfaces in the same seam; do not silently patch around stale math in implementation.

## Subsystems

| Subsystem | Status | Code Homes | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core Microkernel | `green` | `cortex/core`, `cortex/drivers` | Active product law for commitments, provenance, dispatch, and host binding. |
| Shared Runtime Kernels | `green` | `cortex/runtime` | Only shared runtime kernels belong here. |
| Shared Executive | `yellow` | `cortex/sre` | Richer shared executive is active Cortex code; mediation remains experimental/off-by-default even though it lives beside the active SRE family. |
| Host Realizations | `yellow` | `cortex/hosts/openai`, `cortex/hosts/claude`, `cortex/hosts/gemini`, `cortex/hosts/reference` | Host-native shells are part of Cortex reality; shipping truth stays OpenAI-first while Claude, Gemini, and reference remain explicit conformance surfaces. |
| Proof And Data Tooling | `gray` | `lab`, `lab/eval`, `tools` | Proof, evaluation, and maintainer tooling. Useful for falsification, not product truth. |

## Packet To Code

| Packet | Responsibility | Code Homes | Proof Surfaces |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Core` | Lifecycle-first dispatch, commitment extraction, provenance, certification, and bounded environment access. | `cortex/core`, `cortex/drivers` | `tests/product`, `tests/conformance` |
| `SRE` | Reference control policy, branching, brake, uncertainty, verified-work preservation, and reference scoring. | `cortex/sre` | `tests/product`, `tests/experimental` |
| `Host Wiring` | Host-native runtime shells and transport/service bindings for OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and reference. | `cortex/hosts/openai`, `cortex/hosts/claude`, `cortex/hosts/gemini`, `cortex/hosts/reference` | `tests/product`, `tests/conformance` |
| `Lab Proof` | Conformance runners, output-quality tooling, and train-loop evidence used to falsify or prove product seams. | `lab`, `lab/eval` | `tests/lab`, `tests/internal` |

## Hosts

| Host | Shipping | Conformance | Strongest Surface | Daily Iteration | Code Home |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `openai` | `default` | `conformant` | `operator_cli` | `operator_cli` | `cortex/hosts/openai` |
| `claude` | `non-default` | `conformant` | `operator_cli` | `operator_cli` | `cortex/hosts/claude` |
| `gemini` | `non-default` | `conformant` | `operator_cli` | `operator_cli` | `cortex/hosts/gemini` |
| `reference` | `non-product` | `conformant` | `reference_cli` | `reference_cli` | `cortex/hosts/reference` |

## Shipping And Conformance Truth

- Shipping default: `openai:operator_cli`
- Accepted conformance next decision: `promote`

## Closure Gates

Workflow gates marked `required` are contractual gates checked by `repo_workflow.py`, not a claim about every attached local worktree at render time.

| Gate | Status | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `main_synced` | `required` | Required workflow gate: resting truth is enforced through clean synced main and the workflow helper. |
| `cleanup_report` | `required` | Required workflow gate: cleanup-report is the strict final hygiene gate for the resting repo state. |
| `single_truth` | `passed` | The status registry and generated status doc are the only live operational truth surfaces. |
| `legacy_test_buckets_removed` | `passed` | tests/unit and tests/integration are retired in favor of purpose-first active buckets. |

## Next Product Train

- Train: `bounded-live-support-memory-reentry`
- Surface: `experimental + product`
- Executive benefit: Test whether explicit distilled support priors can safely influence narrow live control lanes without hidden policy or stale-memory superstition.
- Why now: Durable support-memory distillation is landed, posture-sensitive online control is now S-tier closed with single-owner posture truth and complete bounded route diagnostics, and anti-thrash is now landed as bounded exact-family repetition tax with novelty reopen; only after that control envelope is explicit should a separate seam test whether any live `Q_mem` re-entry is worth earning.
- Primary metric: `bounded live tasks improve only when explicit distilled priors are injected, while contradiction and TTL invalidation still dominate stale memory`
- Guardrail: `no raw SQLite ingress, no hidden memory path, no truth mutation, and no nonzero shipping/conformance `Q_mem` without separate proof`
- Kill rule: `cut any seam that needs generic reward learning, host myths, or silent memory influence to show lift`

## Where To Work Next

- Keep the bounded audit surface compact and truthful on the shipped lane: selected versus realized family, uncertainty, threshold, delta, verification, and probe truth only.
- Keep the no-spend live evidence current and explicit: fast conformance is green, the deeper directionality and host-native watchlists are refreshed, and non-shipping auth or env caveats must stay explicit instead of silently stale.
- Keep posture and AUX memory law explicit and removable now that posture-sensitive online control is S-tier closed and anti-thrash is landed: inspect is live on cheap non-debt events, resume stays continuity-conditioned, posture truth is single-owned, the route state vector stays the bounded 6-axis geometry term while `visible_burden_sensitivity` remains a separate utility scalar, route truth stays bounded and non-sovereign, unchanged-condition repetition is taxed only at the exact-family level with bounded reopen, raw SQLite episodes stay support-side only, and live `Q_mem` stays zero on shipping and conformance lanes.

## Canonical Proof

**Default**

- `make product-test`
- `make conformance-test`
- `make experimental-test`
- `make -C internal test`
- `make lab-test`

**Status**

- `python3 internal/truth/generate_status.py --check`
- `python3 internal/archive/generate_archive_index.py --check`

**Workflow**

- `python3 internal/workflow/repo_workflow.py sync-main`
- `python3 internal/workflow/repo_workflow.py start-session --agent codex --slug task-name`
- `python3 internal/workflow/repo_workflow.py close-session --message "scope: end-state summary"`
- `python3 internal/workflow/repo_workflow.py close-session --publish --message "scope: end-state summary"`
- `python3 internal/workflow/repo_workflow.py cleanup-report`

## Retained Data

- `conformance` at `.cortex/live_validation/conformance` keeps `accepted_baseline`, `current_candidate`, `latest`
  Policy: Timestamped runs are generated evidence only; manifests and summaries outrank raw timestamp directories.
- `train_loops` at `.cortex/train_loops` keeps `accepted_baseline`, `current_candidate`, `latest`
  Policy: Compact summaries are the maintained view; old train narratives are archival.

## Retained Evidence Refs

- `E23 preservation-state evidence` -> `archive/e23-preservation-state-machine`
  Purpose: Preserved review evidence for the landed preservation-state kernel extract and later provenance checks.

## Blocked Moves

- Do not let archived docs or train notes act as live truth.
- Do not treat lab or evaluation output as product progress unless shipped runtime behavior changes.
- Do not hide Claude or Gemini behind backlog language when reporting conformance.
- Do not route raw AUX SQLite episodes directly into runtime action selection; only distilled removable publications may re-enter.
- Do not let a generic second unrelated episode smuggle a positive AUX prior into retrieval, branch, memory-summary, or uncertainty output.
- Do not let anti-thrash become a global retry ban or a creativity collapse.
- Do not silently widen the 6-axis operator-route geometry vector or hide utility inputs that affect route selection.
- Do not introduce host-specific policy forks to force donor coherence.
- Do not let generic pending-goal debt, plain-English reminder text, or generic `resume*` wake cues act as branch-specific continuity anchors.
