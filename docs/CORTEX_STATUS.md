# CORTEX Status

Surface: product

_Generated from `internal/truth/cortex_status.json`. Edit the registry, then run `python3 internal/truth/generate_status.py`._

## Resting State

- Branch: `main`
- Rule: Clean synced main is the only resting state; the richer Cortex executive remains the product goal, and archive or lab surfaces do not define live product truth.

## Bootstrap

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/CORTEX_STATUS.md`
- `git branch --show-current`
- `git status --short --untracked-files=all`

## Goal

**Rich Executive For AI**

Cortex should be a richer multi-host executive layer for AI work: lifecycle-first, verification-aware, continuity-preserving, and capable of bounded correction without collapsing into host-specific hacks.

Not product:
- `diagnostics`
- `train loops`
- `graders`
- `workflow ledgers`
- `governance records`

## Identity And Research Stance

Cortex is the installable executive layer that wraps a model or host surface and adds executive function to the underlying brain without redefining the brain itself as the product.

Research stance:
- Steal executive skills from systems that already work, especially human executive function, then translate them into small lawful operators, state, gates, and proof surfaces.
- Use first-principles reasoning and live evidence together: start from packet law, then challenge or revise that law explicitly when repeated runtime evidence disproves it.
- Prefer brilliant concrete code when it cleanly realizes the intended executive skill; do not preserve a worse abstraction just because it matched an earlier local framing.

Answering stance:
- When describing Cortex, lead with shipping truth, conformance truth, the current train, and the active quality/risk focus; keep the full executive denominator as background context rather than the front-door headline.
- Always distinguish Cortex truth, shipping truth, conformance truth, and the current train.

## Live Product Truth

- Shipping default: `openai:operator_cli`
- Conformance truth: `openai=conformant`, `claude=conformant`, `gemini=conformant`, `reference=conformant`
- Accepted conformance next decision: `promote`

## Current Focus

- Current tracked train: `openai-operator-cli-proof-reliability`
- Active quality/risk focus: The bounded live-code audit passed locally, but the default no-spend OpenAI operator_cli bookmarks proof hit the full first-attempt timeout and emitted parse-invalid output before falling into repair; until that route is reliable, it is the current blocker.
- Next product train after the current focus: `openai-operator-cli-proof-reliability`

## Denominator / Completion Context

- Current full-executive completion: `100%`
- Shippable threshold for the full executive: `85%`
- Gap to shippable full-executive read: `0` points
- Status mix: `8` landed, `0` partial, `0` north_star
- Scoring rule: `landed=100%`, `partial=30%`, `north_star=0%`
- This score measures progress toward the full executive denominator, not just the current shipping lane.

When user asks where Cortex is at now:
- Start with shipping truth, conformance truth, the current train, and the active quality/risk focus.
- Then give the full-executive denominator as background completion context rather than the front-door headline.
- Then summarize the bio-to-code matrix and the next highest-leverage quality or proof blockers without drifting from Cortex law.

Denominator context from here:
- `No remaining denominator row`: `+0` points if landed. The full executive denominator is already landed, so the active leverage is code-quality, proof-confidence, dead-weight elimination, and live-run reliability rather than score expansion.

## Bio-To-Code Matrix

| Executive Skill | What We Are Stealing | Status | Weight | Code Homes | Proof Surfaces | Next Move |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Truth-preserving commitments and bounded certification | Truth maintenance and reality binding | `landed` | `12` | `cortex/core`, `cortex/drivers` | `tests/product`, `tests/conformance` | Keep this foundation stable while richer executive control builds on top. |
| Bounded correction and verified-work preservation | Error repair without losing the main task thread | `landed` | `15` | `cortex/runtime`, `cortex/sre`, `cortex/hosts/openai` | `tests/product` | Keep preservation-state repair stable while support-side experiments stay removable and off the shipping critical path. |
| Uncertainty handling and brake | Hesitation and uncertainty-aware inhibition | `landed` | `13` | `cortex/sre` | `tests/product`, `tests/experimental` | Keep reference-derived brake and uncertainty control stable while AUX remains advisory and runtime-off-by-default. |
| Branch continuity, suspend/resume, and truthful closure | Working memory across interruptions plus truthful closure | `landed` | `15` | `cortex/sre`, `cortex/hosts/openai` | `tests/product`, `tests/conformance` | Keep suspend/resume and truthful closure stable while any future support memory remains explicit, optional, and non-binding. |
| Intervention pricing versus neutrality | Deciding when to intervene, stay neutral, or stop | `landed` | `10` | `cortex/sre`, `cortex/aux` | `tests/product`, `tests/experimental` | Hold calibrated reference-side intervention pricing stable while gathering cross-host shadow evidence before any non-reference Q_mem ingress or shipping-default change. |
| Blocker surfacing and goal-debt management | Noticing unresolved blockers and unfinished intentions | `landed` | `10` | `cortex/sre`, `cortex/hosts/openai`, `cortex/hosts/claude`, `cortex/hosts/gemini`, `cortex/hosts/reference` | `tests/product`, `tests/conformance` | Keep typed goal-debt and closure-pressure state stable across hosts while support-side augmentation remains explicit and non-sovereign. |
| Multi-host executive continuity | One executive across different brains and contexts | `landed` | `15` | `cortex/hosts/openai`, `cortex/hosts/claude`, `cortex/hosts/gemini`, `cortex/hosts/reference` | `tests/product`, `tests/conformance` | Hold one Cortex law across OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and reference without flattening host-native realization. |
| Offline consolidation and support geometry | Sleep-like consolidation and support systems | `landed` | `10` | `cortex/aux` | `tests/experimental`, `tests/archive`, `tests/conformance` | Keep offline publication explicit, removable, and non-sovereign while testing cross-host shadow usefulness of support-conditioned control before any live non-reference replay rollout. |

## Math To Code Rules

- Every load-bearing executive skill must land as explicit law, typed code, and at least one proof surface.
- Every packet-level mathematical object should map to exactly one typed code object or operator family with one owning module.
- Every typed load-bearing code object should have one clear home and one explicit test or proof surface.
- Forbidden leaks across Core, SRE, AUX, host wiring, and lab proof surfaces must be explicit.
- Law revision rule: The current math is binding landing law until live evidence disproves or narrows it. When that happens, revise the law explicitly and update the code and proof surfaces in the same seam; do not silently patch around stale math in implementation.

## Subsystems

| Subsystem | Status | Code Homes | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core Microkernel | `green` | `cortex/core`, `cortex/drivers` | Active product law for commitments, provenance, dispatch, and host binding. |
| Shared Runtime Kernels | `green` | `cortex/runtime` | Only shared runtime kernels belong here. |
| Shared Executive | `yellow` | `cortex/sre` | Richer shared executive is active Cortex code; mediation remains experimental/off-by-default even though it lives beside the active SRE family. |
| Host Realizations | `yellow` | `cortex/hosts/openai`, `cortex/hosts/claude`, `cortex/hosts/gemini`, `cortex/hosts/reference` | Host-native shells are part of Cortex reality; shipping truth stays OpenAI-first while Claude, Gemini, and reference remain explicit conformance surfaces. |
| Proof And Data Tooling | `gray` | `lab`, `lab/eval`, `tools` | Proof, evaluation, and maintainer tooling. Useful for falsification, not product truth. |

## Packet To Code

| Packet | Responsibility | Code Homes | Proof Surfaces |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Core` | Lifecycle-first dispatch, commitment extraction, provenance, certification, and bounded environment access. | `cortex/core`, `cortex/drivers` | `tests/product`, `tests/conformance` |
| `SRE` | Reference control policy, branching, brake, uncertainty, verified-work preservation, and reference scoring. | `cortex/sre` | `tests/product`, `tests/experimental` |
| `Host Wiring` | Host-native runtime shells and transport/service bindings for OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and reference. | `cortex/hosts/openai`, `cortex/hosts/claude`, `cortex/hosts/gemini`, `cortex/hosts/reference` | `tests/product`, `tests/conformance` |
| `Lab Proof` | Conformance runners, output-quality tooling, and train-loop evidence used to falsify or prove product seams. | `lab`, `lab/eval` | `tests/lab`, `tests/internal` |

## Hosts

| Host | Shipping | Conformance | Strongest Surface | Daily Iteration | Code Home |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `openai` | `default` | `conformant` | `operator_cli` | `operator_cli` | `cortex/hosts/openai` |
| `claude` | `non-default` | `conformant` | `operator_cli` | `operator_cli` | `cortex/hosts/claude` |
| `gemini` | `non-default` | `conformant` | `operator_cli` | `operator_cli` | `cortex/hosts/gemini` |
| `reference` | `non-product` | `conformant` | `reference_cli` | `reference_cli` | `cortex/hosts/reference` |

## Shipping And Conformance Truth

- Shipping default: `openai:operator_cli`
- Accepted conformance next decision: `promote`

## Closure Gates

Workflow gates marked `required` are contractual gates checked by `repo_workflow.py`, not a claim about every attached local worktree at render time.

| Gate | Status | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `main_synced` | `required` | Required workflow gate: resting truth is enforced through clean synced main and the workflow helper. |
| `cleanup_report` | `required` | Required workflow gate: cleanup-report is the strict final hygiene gate for the resting repo state. |
| `single_truth` | `passed` | The status registry and generated status doc are the only live operational truth surfaces. |
| `legacy_test_buckets_removed` | `passed` | tests/unit and tests/integration are retired in favor of purpose-first active buckets. |

## Next Product Train

- Train: `openai-operator-cli-proof-reliability`
- Surface: `lab`
- Executive benefit: Make the default no-spend OpenAI operator_cli proof route return bounded, parseable results so shipping truth is backed by live executable evidence instead of accepted history alone.
- Why now: The live-code audit passed locally, but the default bookmarks proof hit the full first-attempt timeout and only reached the repair lane after parse-invalid output; until that route is reliable, cross-host shadow evidence is not the highest-leverage seam.
- Primary metric: `verified_work_bookmarks_v1 returns a bounded publishable result or explicit env_blocked classification with attempt artifacts on the default no-spend OpenAI operator_cli lane without consuming the full first-attempt timeout`
- Guardrail: `no paid service lane, no host rollout changes, no packet-law widening, and no hiding operator failure behind stale accepted runs or longer timeouts`
- Kill rule: `cut any fix that only lengthens timeouts, suppresses parse-invalid operator output, or shifts proof onto non-default paid surfaces`

## Where To Work Next

- Fix the default no-spend OpenAI operator_cli proof path before expanding into cross-host shadow evidence: on verified_work_bookmarks_v1 the first attempt hit the full five-minute timeout and emitted parse-invalid output before falling into repair.
- Keep shipping truth and the full executive denominator unchanged, but treat live-proof reliability as the current blocker because the audit is ahead of the default executable proof lane.
- Work in lab and internal proof surfaces first: bounded attempt artifacts, parseable operator output, and a clean result or explicit env_blocked classification without hiding failures behind longer timeouts or paid lanes.

## Canonical Proof

**Default**

- `make product-test`
- `make conformance-test`
- `make experimental-test`
- `make -C internal test`
- `make lab-test`

**Status**

- `python3 internal/truth/generate_status.py --check`
- `python3 internal/archive/generate_archive_index.py --check`

**Workflow**

- `python3 internal/workflow/repo_workflow.py sync-main`
- `python3 internal/workflow/repo_workflow.py start-session --agent codex --slug task-name`
- `python3 internal/workflow/repo_workflow.py close-session --message "scope: end-state summary"`
- `python3 internal/workflow/repo_workflow.py cleanup-report`

## Retained Data

- `conformance` at `.cortex/live_validation/conformance` keeps `accepted_baseline`, `current_candidate`, `latest`
  Policy: Timestamped runs are generated evidence only; manifests and summaries outrank raw timestamp directories.
- `train_loops` at `.cortex/train_loops` keeps `accepted_baseline`, `current_candidate`, `latest`
  Policy: Compact summaries are the maintained view; old train narratives are archival.

## Retained Evidence Refs

- `E23 preservation-state evidence` -> `archive/e23-preservation-state-machine`
  Purpose: Preserved review evidence for the landed preservation-state kernel extract and later provenance checks.

## Blocked Moves

- Do not let archived docs or train notes act as live truth.
- Do not treat lab or evaluation output as product progress unless shipped runtime behavior changes.
- Do not hide Claude or Gemini behind backlog language when reporting conformance.
- Do not introduce host-specific policy forks to force donor coherence.
